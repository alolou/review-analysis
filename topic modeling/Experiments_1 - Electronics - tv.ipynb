      "Having only purchased a TV almost 10 years ago (a brand I apparently can't mention) and never having any problems with it (still). My girlfriend and I were looking for an extra TV for our room, plus a def updated newer one. So far, I am very impressed and love all the features. Everything is sleek, smooth and easy to operate. We've only had it for a couple days now but I honestly feel like I made a very great choice that'll last for years.\n",

      "We've had Samsung TV's since 2003 and never been disappointed. This unit solidifies my Brand Loyalty to Samsung's TV product line. This 55 inch - 4K UHDTV SMART LED is the best we've ever had in regards to picture, color spectrum, sharpness and endless options with all the SMART TV functionality. I'm very pleased with this unit as it replaced our Samsung 40 inch - LCD HDTV that we bought in 2005. I would, and have already, recommend this TV to anyone in the market to buy a new one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great to have HDMI connections instead of the coaxial connections like on my old 2002 TV. Love the SMART TV. I have a 55\" 4K UHD model. The remote is sleeker, but it is more of a challenge to learn-few buttons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love this TV and it looks amazing and it performs fantastically. It needs tweaks to the smart hub and service providers and an easier way to loget out of apps but works great overall!\n",
      "\n",
      "I own a Samsung Galaxy S6 and it was on when I started the TV for the first time. The TV initial setup detected my Galaxy S6 and after my approval collected all parameters to connect automatically to my Home Wifi + got my google account. It could not be easier. The features are amazing, re-shuffle of all \"smart apps\" in order of preference + add your own button like my PC so it is easy to switch source, etc... Netflix and Browser work well. TV speaker are good but combined with a Samsung soundbar, it is really a great piece for entertainment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The video is really great. I was skeptical about the remote itself, but later understood why it's made like that because I mostly watch netflix and use other apps on my television. The apps are easy to find as well. I like the fact that when I turn on the TV, everything else turns on automatically (soundbar, PS4, etc)\n",

      "picture is very clear,functions are easy to use,installation was easy\n",
      "\n",
      "Initial impression is that the picture is outstanding. Very disappointed that there is no headphone jack. I have hearing loss and like to use headphones. Had to connect headphones to cable box, meaning no headphone use when watching DVDs or video tapes. Had difficulty programming Harmony remote controls with new TV. Took Geek Squad 2 hours to figure out workaround. Limited audio/video inputs meant we had to connect VCR via coaxial cable into normal antenna feed. Picture and sound are great. Couldn't connect to internet, but that is problem with my wifi signal in the house, not TV issue. Size is perfect for our room.\n",

      "This is by far the best television I ever bought. The picture is so vivid. Audio is awesome! For it's class, it's the best money can buy. The display in comparison to the others on display was a \"no brainer!\" Thanks Samsung!\n",
      "\n",
      "We recently bought a 55' UHD TV. The picture is so precise and clear, I don't even need to use my glasses to see the TV! The sound is awesome and I absolutely love having a Smart TV to view Netflix, Vudu.\n",

      "\n",
      "I have been doing research to buy a good 4k tv for 2 months. There were not much valued tv-s for the price i was looking for. Then I found this one for the affordable price within my budget. The great thing is even though it costs you a 100 dollars more you can save it on sound bar since the sound quality of this tv is astonishing. I have the 60\" tv and the picture quality is absolutely stunning. Factory setup is good for the view but you may have to tweak more to get the picture quality you want. TV is very easy to setup and all its functions are very easy to operate. The remote is uniquely small and handy. It has got bluetooth connectivity as well to connect ur bluetooth headset. I bet you will like it.\n",

      "i had a different brand with same 4k uhd this time i want to buy for my bedroom so i am thinking which one should i supposed to buy and i am really very much happy with my previous one so it ios very hard to take decision but when i bought this one i was just shocked , amzing tv from each and every corner means all features are wonderful. so i am very thankful to myself that i made a decision to buy such a wonderful tv.\n",
      "\n",
      "This television has a great picture that is bright and good depth of color. The remote control and user interface on the television are super simple and it does everything needed. The user interface is very snappy and doesn't normally lag. My only complaint so far is that the TV doesn't come with the four screws needed to use the VESA mount. The VESA mount I purchased had the right screws except they were too long, I had to use a hacksaw to shorten the mounting screws. VESA mounting screws sould be included with the TV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't be fooled by this fooled by this TV. It DOES NOT get the Time Warner App! Its like the only Samsung TV that doesn't get it for some ridiculous reason. The amount of apps you can actually get are minimal. This is not a smart TV, this is a dumb TV....\n",
      "\n",
      "This 4K ultra HD TV has the best picture of any Samsung TV I have purchased. I replace my HD 55 inch Samsung with this 65 inch model and the improvement in the picture was easy to see. We love the bright colors and the clarity on all channels. The smart hub is excellent with the apps we use most. I have always bought Samsung and I was not disappointed with this new 4K ultra model.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was very easy to set up. .It barely took 20 minutes. The colors are so crisp its like they are right here.. the clarity is awesome as well.. I would recommend the product to anyone.. Even the syncing of tv to the remote was easy..it almost set up itself..\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of things you may need to bypass during set up, but after that you will love its features and visual...\n",
      "\n",
      "This is our third Samsung product and we are very pleased with it. The last Samsung TV was a 50\" DLP and we never changed the bulb in 11 years of owning it. We were told it would last 2-3 years. Great, great products from Samsung. I'm sure we'll have just as great service from our new TV.\n",

      "Just got this TV over the weekend. Was through the setup process and streaming 4k content withing an hour. Bright and true colors, lots of options for tuning the picture as desired. Sound is surprisingly good for such a thin chassis. The glare when viewing from the side in a bright room is annoying but, In all, very happy!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have another,older Samsung Smart TV. I like the remote control on the older model much better. The remote control on the new TV is too small and is easily misplaced. I also like the stand that the older TV came on. Other than that The TV us fine\n",
      "\n",
      "Great quality for the money spent. Picture is amazing and I love all the apps that are preloaded to this tv. Has a great sound to it. Love the spoken word option. It really brings out dialogue from the background noises. Not gonna find a better deal for 4K than this tv. Puts my 1080p to shame.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is our first 4k TV. It has amazing quality. It is very user friendly. We have always been a big fan of Samsung products. This is our 4th Samsung TV for the house. We tried another brand due to it was cheaper, however we return it the first day because it was just not nearly as good as Samsung.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had another 42 inch of another brand and something ended its life prematurely. I have had this tv for several months, now and am completely satisfied. It was new technology at the time. I bought it at a store that guaranteed the low price. When I got it home, I literally couldn't believe the quality of the picture. I remember putting in a dvd and remarking how intense the lighting was. It was obvious that they needed much more light when the movie was filled. It actually looked like you were watching from the sound stage. I don't regret paying more for mine. It was a great price back then. 20 years ago, I gave much more for a 36 inch tube set. Buy this. I think that the tv has maxed out what the eye can distinguish.\n",
      "\n",
      "T.V. has a fantastic picture and I am well pleased with all the features of the t.v as a smart t.v. I am still in the process of leaning how to work all the different features. I have had recent experience with Samsung as I recently purchased a Galaxy S-7 smart phone and it is excellent. My only problem is learning how to operate all the features of both products but I will learn.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Easiest setup for a TV that I have seen. Out of the box and watching the DISH in 20 minutes. *Vivid colors, crisp picture *Awesome controller, Samsung control has nine buttons and performs all functions that I can perform with my 33 button DISH controller, less buttons, very nice. *I have recommended this 50 inch model to all my friends, for the value and high quality picture that it delivers.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is our 2nd. Samsung TV. The previous set was only 2 yrs. old and was working perfectly until severe lightning strike blew surge protector and destroyed it. The advances in this model are great. The picture quality is excellent as is sound and ease of operation. We are completely satisfied with overall performance as of this writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great picture. User friendly. Easy to mount on wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a treat to see 4K in your home.. Picture and colors are out of this world and live sports really shine! Easy set up and fantastic features to super tune to your personal preferences. Now my second 4K Samsung.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anyone is looking for a high performance TV at a reasonable price, this is it. Excellent quality in performance and design. I'm a PRO Samsung customer and they've continued their excellence in TVs. Highly recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "I purchased this tv to replace the out standing Samsung 61inch LED DLP tv. I thought this was a tall order But this tv is holding it own. The picture is mind blowing the sound is excellent . The only negative is the remote control. It very unattractive and takes a lot from this magnificent tv. I hope they produce a replacement remote worthy of this tv. The bottom line is ,\"I love this tv\".\n",
      "\n",
      "I purchased this for gaming in my office, excellent product for a gaming 4K TV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bought this TV to upgrade my 6 year old 46\" Toshiba and I have nothing but praise for it. It's really bright, after tweaking the colors they look accurate and brilliant and the motion rate is awesome compared to many TVs that I shopped around for. The only dings would be that the design is mostly black with just a tiny bit of pizazz from the gray stand and the color uniformity in a gray screen showing a bit of lighter areas (they look like little squares on the TV). But other than that I'm in love with it, would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a TV. Samsung never disappoints!\n",
      "\n",
      "Would highly recommend based on ease of set-up and quality of picture - outstanding It automatically picked up all related remotes and devices and the set- up was very easy. A great relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "This TV is good enough quality for home use, the only thing is the design is not thin enough. So far I'm happy with it. I would recommended it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so impressed with the ease of setting this tv up and I was concerned with pairing the cable remote to the tv but a quick zip code entered brought up my choice of cable in my area. As a senior I have so many friends who don't want the \"smart\" tv because of the difficulty in figuring it all out but this was very simple. The remote was so easy to manage once I got used to it and the adding and removing the apps ever so easy. So glad I made the switch to this very high resolution and beautiful viewing tv. We also added the samsung soundbar which makes for really good audio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wasn't familiar with the advances made in recent years until I started this Tv. It immediately went through the setup of cable, satellite, wifi, etc. Last night we watched a movie from a USB memory stick. The previous nite we learned how it connects easily with Hulu, internet, YouTube, etc. It has so many features that it will take a while to learn all of them. Each day, brings a new revelation in its usage. Its ultra high definition of films gives the viewer the impression of being right within the scenery. Unbeatable as far as tv experiences go.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not be happier with this TV. I was going to pay to fix an old DLP TV but decided to invest in this instead. boy did it pay off. The Ultra 4K HD is better than my own vision. This is a must have TV. Top of the line quality A++++\n",
      "\n",
      "This TV has a great picture quality and its loaded with function and apps.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is unlike all the other tv's you've ever owned. Most tv's look exceptional in the big box stores on demo mode but this tv actually delivers in your home as well. The display is so vivid and crisp that I often have to turn down the display because it's almost too much clarity. If you pair this set with a good sound bar you'll be in your own home theater. The price comparison is exceptional for what you get. If you're on the fence, trust me, BUY IT!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "We both feel like we are right in the middle of the action. The picture quality is exceptional. Love it!\n",
      "\n",
      "This has a Awesome Image and it's as smart as they come. It's the little things, such as the new 2016 smart remote not being able to do a simple thing as turning on and off the \"Cable Box\". The only other thing is not being able to know the signal type that's being feed, 720/1080/4k when the signal changes. Knowing that your really viewing a 4k signal would be nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "This TV had the sharpest and brightest display in the store. Comparing picture and features in the store this TV has it all. I've watched King Kong and Lord of the Rings and haven't been disappointed with anything yet. It's like having the Big Screen from the theater come to my house only better.\n",
      "\n",
      "This 60\" Samsung TV Rocks! We absolutely love it, the picture, the speed, the set-up. The remote is so easy to use. It really is a smart TV. The HD on this TV is amazing, our whole family enjoys this Samsung product. We could not be happier with our purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just owning this TV for a week, I have thoroughly enjoyed it. Sports, Blu-rays and 4K programming all look fantastic. And, not only is the picture great, the value was fantastic. I would highly recommend checking this TV out.\n",
      "\n",
      "This 4k tv goes very well with my samsung 4k blu ray player picture quality with hdr is great\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent picture, smart hub service hookup easy. Only criticism is that the remote was sparse in terms of controls and I would have preferred number buttons for entering channels. Many button pushes required to enter a TV channel.\n",
      "\n",
      "love the features of t.v smart hub got all apps...can use my tv like my laptop...awesome smart t.v\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my first 4K or UHD TV, but I am still amazed at the color and features on this TV. The first unit we received would have a random black screen flicker, but we exchanged it for a new unit. The second unit is bright and vibrant and works great. Setup is very simple, and the SMART menu is great!\n",
      "\n",
      "Very easy to set up and program my cable and blu ray. Feels like I am sitting in a movie theater. Great TV, Great price for this unit!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Control that came with the tv is not very smart, very limited how you can control the tv other then turn off and on change channels and adj the volume. any control can do that\n",
      "\n",
      "The quality of the picture made me less sad the plasma TV died. Streaming Netflix with ease! Just purchased.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our TV is brand new, but so far there is a great picture and the set-up was fantastic. It found our cable system and blue-ray player with no problem. Colors are vibrant and picture is very clear. The built-in speakers are great.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had been seeing great reviews of this new tv from new owners, and once the set was available in my local market I couldn't wait to get it. Setup was a breeze. Really smooth. Picture looked really good. Once I got the tv setup I went in and made some adjustments to the picture. There are quite a few options related to type of picture viewing to choose from. I had also heard the sound quality for such a thin set was really quite good. Upon setting this up I would say its much better than I thought it would be. Again, nice choice of sound options to choose from. Remote is interesting. Nothing like my 2009 samsung hd, but I am learning it. I do like it. So far I love the tv, and would highly recommend it to others who want to get into the UHD world. I love my new Samsung!\n",
      "\n",
      "Can't beat the price as for what you get. I had the 60\" ju7090 in which I was very happy with. I wanted something bigger. Yea i will miss the 3d for sure, but you gain the hdr technology. I notice this beast has a better picture and less motion blur than the ju7090. I also have the Samsung k8500 4k player. I watched deadpool 4k hdr and really couldn't see the difference. I'll give it more time. PS4 gaming was awesome in game mode. Don't let the 120hrz fool you having going from a 240mr on the ju7090 to this model. The remote will take time to master but happy so far. I bought (aka rented) this from bb and may actually keep this as i like it a lot so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "love the design of the controller and the tv. sharp picture and handles streaming service well, works well with over the air tv. has a guide just like with cable\n",
      "\n",
      "I REALLY LIKE THIS 6 SERIES TV HAS A GREAT PICTURE LOTS OF FETURES I DO NOT NEED BUT THERE IF YOU LIKE TO USE THEM. WIRELESS FEATURE IS REALLY GREAT ALSO..\n",
      "\n",
      "Sleek, sexy, well designed TV. Bright, vibrant picture with fast performing apps.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this TV after reading professional reviews of many different UHD TVs. I use it mostly for watching sports and streaming internet content. The picture is fantastic. The only minor complaints that I have are that judder is present during movies and that the remote has very few buttons (leaving you to navigate through the options on screen). Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is only 3 days old. So far the Picture is Crystal Clear and navigation with the Smart Remote is flawless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Set up was very easy, the picture and sound are awesome after a month I decided to check out the apps and can not believe how simple it was, went as far as linking my Samsung Mobile and can now view my photos and videos on the tv... happy happy\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my first smart tv and I am surprised at how user friendly the interface is. Colors are so vibrant and the picture quality is amazing. The audio is very good even without the sound bar. The design is sleek and fits the tv nook perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "We just purchased our new Samsung UHD 50\" TV (we already own several Galaxy phones and a Blu-Ray player. We shopped for a TV with a stand that would work with our bedroom dresser and the field was narrow but we are thrilled with this TV!\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of the tv is ok but it has serious defects. It turns itself off and also changes the source several times per night. Have a message to service who can hopefully report this highly defective product.\n",
      "\n",
      "We just installed the new Samsung this past weekend. The install was easy, painless. Picture quality, sound, appearance, etc have exceeded our expectations. We have Samsung phones and tablet and are anxious to pursue the inter-connectivity of the devices w/the TV.\n",
      "\n",
      "This high resolution 4K device has exceeded my expectations for picture quality and audio performance. The remote device is adequate but needs a number pad aside from the on-screen one. The wall mount is excellent with tilt feature and secure fastening to stud and wall board for stability. Good choice for me at a good price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous purchase was defective. Replaced with current TV.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife are amazed by the clarity of the 65\" TV but we beamed with joy when the cable company technician came to re-program our old remote and he said, \"Wow, what a great picture!\" Now how many TV's do you suppose he has seen? Yes, it's a great picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "remote takes getting used to great I can stream directly to screen from my computer. very clear picture\n",
      "\n",
      "This television by far has the best features, refresh rate, picture, sound quality and so much more! After having many different brands of televisions, Samsung has the best television on the market these days. My husband and I had originally planned on purchasing the 65' UHD Curved version of this television, but to our demise, they were out of stock. We now intend to only purchase Samsung products for all of our future appliance needs! Thank you for making such an amazing product, we are very satisfied customers!\n",
      "\n",
      "This product is a diamond in the rough. Priced fair full of options and an overall pleasure to own. I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very disappointed with this TV considering no Screen Mirroring...My 2013 smart tv was having this feature but not this TV...very disappointed... Also the important apps like, Willow cricket and Crackle also not there.... Even the web browser won't play anything as it always asks about Adoble flash.... Don't recommend to anybody\n",
      "\n",
      "This product was hard to setup especially when the tv isn't talking to the controller. It is difficult to figure this out. After this step is finally completed everything is great. The picture and sound are the best ever for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I purchased the TV and found the ease of setting it up wonderful. The quality of the picture and the efficient remote system are a big plus for me. I am very happy with the purchase and I would recommend this product to everyone. In addition, I have had great experiences with other Samsung products and am extremely pleased to do business with this company.\n",
      "\n",
      "So many TVs to choose from, but very pleased with this choice! Picture very crisp and clear. Good size TV for our room dimensions. Sound quality good, but even better with sound bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Went from a dorm-room 17\" screen to the 50\" and will never go back. Incredibly clear display quality with solid sound and barely noticeable lag in on-screen motion in comparison to other carriers. All the features of a UHD smart TV are easily accessible as well. Very competitively equipped for the price point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good for 4k movies and games, support 1080p, 2k and 4k at 60 frames, plus other resolutions. Low input lag. Excellent performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "GREAT PICTURE GREAT SIZE APPS 4K TV .....................................\n",
      "\n",
      "This tv is a great addition to our living room, clean crisp picture. It's a great choice if your wallet has a budget. You still will experience a great viewing experiance without breaking the bank. I would recommend this tv to anyone looking for one. I looked at many other tv's and thus was buy far the best deal and rhe picture is as good as the more expensive ones out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "This TV has the best screen I've ever owned and the response is really really fast. Watching movies and playing video games is also really fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like my purchase so far. I have only had it for a day but it is working very well. The picture quality is beautiful!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not only impressed with the quality of the screen on this television, but I'm also very pleased that someone finally realized that remote controls don't have to be the size of a tablet to be extremely effective! My only disappointment was realizing that even though we paid fully for a \"new\" TV, we were sold a refurbished one-as confirmed by the tech who came by to make a minor adjustment for us. However, the service was fantastic and quick, and the company was very very honest about what we were sold. Good product, but bad business practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "I started working on TV's in 1974 when Cathode Ray Tubes were used. Never in my life have I \"EVER\" seen a display so poorly designed and built that it cracks from 'hand' pressure. To say it isn't durable is a horrible understatement.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am completely satisfied with my purchase. The picture quality is superb. I feel like I am at the movies. I really enjoy the internet and Netflix. My Grandkids love watching their programs and sports on this TV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have had the TV for 2 months now. So far we like it very much! But there are some improvements that could be made. The sound could be improved, when there is too much bass, there is a nasty vibration that comes from where the speakers are. Also, the stand (we can't mount on the wall) could be more sturdy. But for the price, it a decent TV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great pitcher quality easy to set up and use. Took less time then all the TVs i have set up.\n",
      "\n",
      "great picture and sound for a very reasonable price. replacing a Samsung TV that I have had for 9 years with no problems,I just need to update my TV in order to stream media, and this does that.I won't buy any other brand of electronics.\n",

      "Great Picture ,great color ,easy remote ,easy to set-up Bought at best buy .salesmen very helpful. would recommend to friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hardly write reviews ..... but this TV made me do so!!!! My kids love it, picture quality is awesome! Hardly 10 seconds to set it up, very light! Oh, the remote is the best remote you can get, works with your set top boxes also, finds out automatically your cable providers based on some info. And it works very well with wifi, our router is a bit far (in another room) but this works like a charm! Thank you Samsung :) I got a great deal on the price and if you have never had a UHD, you will see a huge difference in how you have been watching TV all these years ....\n",
      "\n",
      "I needed to replace my old 40\" samsung LCD. And based on the options I needed the new tv to have, I really didn't have much choices, and the sales person recommended me to look at this tv, and I could not be any happier. Beautiful display, loots of ports to connect your entertainment electronics. It was so easy to setup, it felt like setting up a new phone, and I didn't have to write anything since it found my galaxy S7 near, and ask me if I wanted to use my phone to setup Internet, Samsung account and, etc. I think that the Series 6 TVs are the best of both worlds, value, quality, and all the extras.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great picture and sound. Really make realstic viewing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great TV. went from 42\" Samsung Plasma to 55\"UHD Samsung Smart tv. Had a mac mini hooked to the plasma tv. don't need it now It's really big. both are great tv's. still using old plasma in kids room\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall the TV is good. It looks bit expensive but when compared to the quality of the picture and sound, it is worth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only complaint I have so far is the remote won't shut up every time I press a button she speaks and speaks really fast and I don't know how to turn that feature off\n",
      "\n",
      "It may not be a SUHN, but I love the clear pictures and the sound isn't too bad for a flat screen television either.\n",

      "had this tv for a week now and no problems.great color and picture quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had this TV for a couple of months now and I really like it. It has great features, it's easy to set up, and has a really intuitive and simple remote control. The picture quality is amazing! The only thing that I do not like about it is the the base that comes with the TV does not allow the TV to swivel (left/right)\n",
      "\n",
      "I love SAMSUNG products because of their ratings and because I have purchased SAMSUNG products for years. Cellphones, Tablets, Monitors etc. and have never been disappointed. The quality of their products and the ease of \"understanding\" their easy installation, and setup keeps me buying SAMSUNG when I need something.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just bought this 50 inch TV a couple days ago, and have enjoyed it ever since. It's the first time we TV with such a big picture ( 50 inch ) and it amazing how clear the picture is. I would recommend the Samsung TV to anyone who is looking for a new TV.\n",
      "\n",
      "This television is awesome. Picture quality and options available to control picture in various lighting automatically amongst other features makes it a great choice. This was a great value! I would recommend this TV to anyone and have already supplied the SAMSUNG link to several friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Samsung's customer service is excellent and fixed the problem I was having with the picture freezing (just a simple settings change) and the TV is working just fine. It took me a little time to understand what a smart TV was all about but I finally figured it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "BEST TV I HAVE GOTTEN FOR MYSELF IN A LONG TIME THINGS LOOK SO MUCH MORE ALIVE\n",

      "Can't wait to show off our new TV. The picture quality is outstanding. Easy directions to install. Looks good in my cabinet.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have this TV only for two weeks. So far it works good but picture quality is difficult to adjust. Remote control sometimes is not working as intended to work. Smart features are easy to operate. Overall we are happy with this purchase and would recommend to anybody to get this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Received my 4K UHD TV yesterday and more than ECSTATIC with my purchase! Took time to research numerous TVs before purchasing and after everything I read in reviews, I am glad I made the choice of SAMSUNG! The color is amazing! The options are terrific! The size is everything I was hoping for and more! And the price couldn't be beat for all this TV has to offer! This happy customer will be more than glad to pass along to others that this TV is a great choice!\n",
      "\n",
      "We enjoy the 4k und also very easy to set-up. Easy to go online receives Wi-Fi well. The sound is just O.K. Also a great feature is the stand you do not need a oversize cabinet to hold it.\n",
      "\n",
      "A high tech tv, from the ease of setup, to the easy navigating of the on screen menu, and simple to us remote this tv is way ahead of the other brands out there. Beautiful colors and a bright picture. Nice whites and black blacks make this UHD tv enjoyable to watch no matter what you're watching. In my opinion Samsung is hard to beat.\n",
      "\n",
      "A well illustrated User Guide/Manual, in PDF available for free download will go a long way to enhance the experience of using this set, since there are so many features that you can't get to unless one plays around with it 24x7. The flimsy 17 page instructions that came with the product is a waste of paper & a joke. Samsung please consider this request because you have a great product. Since the remote has so few buttons, it too can do with a design change that makes it more user friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "No showtime, crackle and numerous other apps are not available, I would not have purchased the TV knowing this\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband bought this TV to use as a super monitor for his stock program. It has worked very well, crisp clear numbers at a size that is good for his sight. He is very pleased with his purchase, and bought another one to use in another room where he sometimes trades.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another Samsung product added to my electronic collection. This time a 50\" 4K Smart TV for the bedroom. Great picture, super options, lots of smarts, and an easy to use remote that can control more than just the TV! It even connects with my Samsung S7 edge phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wonderful picture. I'm having a bit of trouble with the smart TV though. It has been taking way too long to load the streaming videos even with high speed internet. I hope to figure out the problem.\n",

      "\n",
      "I've had it for just 2 weeks but it's going great so far. I love how great it looks on our family room. And the sound is just fantastic! I attached an ethernet cable and the kids love browsing the internet and watching You Tube videos. I just wish there were more UHD channels available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice look well disign with great image picture, the sound is great for a Tv, the bleuthoot connection with my receiver has huge delay and drop some time. The HDMI ARC disconnect everytime you turn TV off and you always have to unplug the TV to reconnect . I still beleive that samsung can make this product better\n",
      "\n",
      "We bought this TV to replace an older one that was losing it's viewing quality. Since we had another Samsung TV & enjoyed it so much we bought another Samsung this time around. THANKS Samsung for such a great product at a great price! We're looking forward to watching this TV for many more years.\n",

      "\n",
      "Lightweight, modern design. Great picture,apps and sound. Owned Samsung's in the past and that's what decided what my current purchase was going to be. 4K makes you feel as though you are inside tv.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every time I purchase another brand, I'm a bit disappointed. This TV is spectacular, easy setup, quality, and extras are worth the small premium price. Support has also never disappointed me. What a great display. I still don't know why new monitors include speakers but, there must be a demand. Personally, with a high quality picture, high quality sound is a must.\n",
      "\n",
      "Samsung technology is amazing! I searched for this particular model after reading many positive reviews online. When I received the set (50\" size), I was able to set up by myself because the weight was very manageable. The picture is incredible for me. Yes, there are more expensive and higher definition TVs out there, but this 4K UHD has a great wow factor and doesn't break the bank. I bought a Samsung 8000 series several years ago for more than twice the price of this one and I feel the visual impact of this 4K 6300 series is phenomenal in comparison. The audio on this 6300 set is great too! No \"immediate\" rush to get a sound system to increase the volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "4K is the way to go. The picture just jumps at you. It's like your there. Can't wait till they add more apps. Love that i can watch Netflix originals in 4 K. Colors are superb.\n",

      "I really like the tv. It's easy to use. The remote is simple. It looks nice. The picture is great. My old tv had better sound but it's nothing a sound bar can't fix. But it keeps flickering every now and then and the store won't take it back and says it's a Samsung issue?\n",

      "The 2016 Samsung 4K TV's, the KU6300 in particular, have terrible software. The Smart Hub frequently loses all the icons that allow a user to switch between sources, i.e. TV, DVD player, Cable box, etc. This problem can be fixed, temporarily, by restoring the TV to factory settings, meaning that you have to go through a complete set up as if the set were new, out of the box. I've had to do this four times. While the set has a nice picture, the sound, like all flat-panel TV's, is terrible. It would be a good value but since the software is horrible I would not recommend this product. I have a Samsung purchased in 2015 that works very well. However the 2016 model is terrible and should be avoided.\n",

      "Before I purchased this particular television, for over a year I shopped the market for size, features, and cost value. When I found this set on sale, I purchased it and have not been disappointed. It is hooked up a a surround sound system and the sound is terrific. The remote takes a few minutes to get used to. Although I seldom need a PC hookup, this set does not have the necessary plug. Other than that, I did make the right purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "The graphics is unbelievably awesome. There are choices to set the screen mode to but the default setting is a favorite. With the sound options, there's no beating the movie setting which makes for great stereo surround sound. No need for additional accessories, such as speakers, subwoofer, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the 2015 Christmas Holiday Season I comparison shopped Samsung 4K SUHD Smart TV's against the other leading brands in the market. What sold me on Samsung was the excellent color and resolution of the picture which far exceeded all other makes I reviewed.. I am totally pleased with my recently purchased 50\" Samsung TV.\n",
      "\n",
      "the second i turned it on the picture and sound and features are great.and to top it off my wife even loves it.\n",

      "The 4k 4:4:4 Chroma Sampling performance at 60 FPS is stunning. I have mine hooked up to a GTX 1070 SLI setup and after plugging the PC into HDMI 1(with a HDMI 2.0 High Speed Cable) and setting that input to UHD Color Mode I was able to select 4:4:4 on my pc because it detected the TV has a new TV after switching this crucial setting. This is very important because you will not see the option to set it in your display drivers until the Input is set to UHD color mode. Blacks are deep and whites are bright , colors are playful and input lag is very minimal. Cobine this with above par motion blurring and you have a great 4K monitor w/ 50' to spare. If you can game at 4K this is definitely worth the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is very good TV. I just wish that TV companies would figure out a way to make their LCD screens way more durable. This is my 2nd one as that first one broke pretty easily.\n",

      "Thank you Samsung for making this product. I just love watching on this tv. The picture clarification is just awesome and the user interface is so compitable and easy to operate. It's a great sound system with a perfect, smart and handy remote which is so easy to scroll. And I can't forget to mention the web surfing .. trust me it works so well I am able to watch videos by opening links . I love the big screen and makes me feel a proud owner thank you so much guys .\n",

      "\n",
      "Now that we've had it for awhile, I feel I can write an honest review. It's fairly light weight and easy to hangup. The color is true and is bright/sharp. The sound on the TV itself is good even though we switch it to our surround system. It makes no sound when you turn it on or off. Very pleased with this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our third major Samsung product and as usual very satisfied. Great clear picture and easy setup out of the box. Speakers need to be supplemented with a sound bar but that's typical of flat screens. A little hazy on instructions for setting up an xbox one properly but a minor concern. Very happy so far and has been combined with DirecTV 4K genie system for a great picture and depth of color.\n",

      "First this replaced a one year old series 6 TV that grand kids broke. Got TV home and out of box set it up with all wires and cables hooked up. Then came the fun part of programming the set. The new smart remote was scary because no letters or numbers on it but after a few minutes of playing with it, it all came together.This was the easiest TV I have set up in a long time. Everything paired up, my U-Verse system from AT&T, there remote for there system. Just a wonderful set if I can keep the grand kids from throwing wooden blocks at this one it will last a long time. The only thing I did not really like was the stand, I liked the old base that was wider, not the long wing type that came with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though 4K broadcasts are not being received, the 4K UHD picture (and sound) are great. The remote is smart, but lacks the conveniences that we prefer of additional (conventional) buttons. Simplified is nice, but all the conveniences are not there without a lot more click, select, click, click, select, click, click, click (etc.). Thanks Samsung: Great product.\n",
      "\n",
      "This TV has beat all my expectations. I can't see spending any more for a TV. Samsung TV's are the only TV's I will buy.\n",

(easiest connection to my bluetooth headphones I've had) I give it 5 stars because, as TV's go, it's perfect and I haven't found any flaws, yet. Maybe if I find some I'll knock it down a star but it's an excellent TV so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great television. I am so happy with it. I have an Amazon Fire TV streaming box with 4k but find that I don't need it because of the smart features on this tv. This is a definite buy!\n",

      "It has been over 4 months since I purchased this Awesome TV and it's overdue for a review of how wonderful this TV performs. 1: Picture quality... Very good in fast motion viewing such as Football game or car racing, and Colors are very sharp, live like clarity....5 Stars. 2: Sound Quality....It offers a good sound out of the box, but it gets even better with adding a Theater sound System...........4 Stars. 3: Hardware design....Very Modern and attractive as well as space saving, plenty of inputs....5 Stars. 4: Software design...Very Smart TV, simple to set up and use, love the sleek uncluttered remote, connects really well with other devices.........5 Stars. 5:Value...This TV did not disappointment me in anyways, it's an excellent value for your money....5 Stars.\n",

All I had to do was buy a remote and a playstation subscription and I can play over 4000 games as well as all the tv and movies. I didnt get out of bed for 4 straight days just watching my tv when i first got it! The quality is amazing! I'm gonna make all the tvs in my house smart tvs\n",

      "You need 2 people to set up the stand. When I got stuck in the set up process, I called the Samsung help line and they were great, patient and confident that we would get it done. The ability to change audio to Sports, Movies, etc. is easy. I would recommend a Samsung soundbar which comes on when powering up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been wanting the new 4K technology for a long time since it's release. I saw the pure quality in the stores and was sold on my experience next to other competing brands. I don't have a 4k Blu-ray player yet but I have been5 using the Samsung 1000w Surround Blu-ray system and it is a \"must have\" addition for total movie experience. I am lad to purchase this series of the Samsung 4K but next TV will be the 240Hz model for even more true motion stability. Thanks\n",
      "\n",
      "I really like this television , the size is great, (60\"), and the picture has great color. The sound is pretty good considering it is coming out the back of the tv. This is my second Samsung television, the other one is a 46\" and I really like the upgraded size. The only thing I don't like is the remote, but I did adapt to using it.\n",
      "\n",
      "it's wonderful. everything it was claimed to be. I never used that type of remote and it came with no real explanation, which left me confounded for a while. TV's great and I didn't destroy the remote before figuring it out, so I'm happy. good purchase.\n",

      "Our previous TV went out late one night after barely a year of use. We decided to go with a Samsung vs. a competitor, as I'm super happy with their phones. This unit is far and beyond an upgrade from our previous TV and a tremendous value. Excellent picture, intuitive UI, and the eco features are a very nice touch. Would highly recommend it!\n",

      "\n",
      "I completed a lot of searching and reading reviews on several TV's and I always came back to this one. I finally made the purchase and could not be more satisfied. The speakers could use a boost but I knew I was going to use a sound bar, so that is no big deal to me. I love all of the features and remote. The power cord connection could use some tweaking, I turned the tv to position it once and it became disconnected from the back of the tv. Minor issues but still very satisfied!!\n",

      "\n",
      "I saw the tv on as a floor model, thing Wow what an awesome picture. But from past experiences, when you get it home it' never compare to the store. But this time it actually is everything, plus set up to the internet was fast and the remote is so slim sleek and easy to use. Picture Quality A+\n",

      "\n",
      "I have had this Television for less than a month and now when is is idle/off for more than 4 hours, the remote will not turn it on. The first time I had to unplug the set in the rear, plug it back in and then the remote would work. the second time I used the pad located on the right rear and that turned it on. I contacted Samsung and had to when load new software on to a USB flash drive because the TV would not link wirelessly with my router. This is the first Samsung product I have ever bought, I would recommend Samsung but I don't think I will ever buy another.\n",

      "\n",
      "This is the second one we buy. we had the previews model for my parents and we got this one for us. The image quality is amazing. the smart hub is great, could be a bit better but overall its great. The option to control the TV from the phone or pc is cool and so comfortable!\n",

      "You can't go wrong on the 55\" 6300 Series Samsung television. Every category, especially the price, are all 5 stars.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I purchased this TV two weeks ago and am very pleased. Brilliant colors and great sound. I can see details on actors and scenery that I could not see before. I gave a good rating on features because I was looking forward to using it as a wireless monitor for my Windows Surface Pro 4 computer and I cannot get the software to work. Also using the apps on the TV have issues with internet connection so I use the Xbox for streaming on Hulu .\n",

      "Just bought this tv today and it is incredible.I had a plasma tv before this(still working after 8 years,but wanted something newer.This blows away my plasma by a long shot.Price was right and I love it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had this product for several days now and am very pleased with it. I'm moving to a flat-screen from a very old but serviceable CRT that was top of the line 25 years ago. It finally gave up the ghost and forced my hand - time to enter the 21st century. I thought that it would be wise to look forward a bit and go for an UHD unit despite the limited content available. My space is tight and this 40\" just barely fits into my cabinet. It is very reasonably priced for the features and performance. I don't have much UHD content to look at so far, but conventional HD shows are a pleasure to view. Like most sets today, you will probably need to play with the picture and sound settings to match your viewing needs. My only caveats are: Sound is nothing special out of the box. Off-angle viewing is not great. The streamlined control takes some getting used to - I think I'll like it, though. For the price, this unit is highly recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this TV to upgrade from an early Samsung 32\" LCD TV and wasn't sure I really needed too as the original unit was still working perfectly but once I got it home and turned it on the picture was so vibrant and just jumped off the screen. I still watch it in almost disbelief at the clarity and realism of the colors. I am not quite as happy about the remote or controls options as although somewhat better than previous Samsung efforts they don't seem to be very good at intuitive controls and making anything easy in this respect. I'm still trying to find a phone app that will control the TV well with no luck. Fortunately I use a third party Smart TV unit on the TV so stay away from Samsungs Smart TV interface\n",
      "\n",
      "Bought this TV for our bedroom. Fits perfectly in the space. Picture is beautiful! Easy Setup. Love it!\n",

Easy remote connections, no entering of codes, just point it at the tv and select your cable provider. Download the smart view app and you can have a remote on your phone or tablet, and stream your photos and videos to the tv. Connect multiple devices, like a Bluetooth keyboard, DUALSHOCK game pad or USB game pad., USB flash drive or a hard drive. A keyboard is a must if surfing the web, as typing on the screen keyboard is slow do to having to move the cursor around with the remote.

      "The ease and simplicity of operation is very nice. Nice big TV and a very reasonable price! Another HDMI port would be nice. The TV lacked the M8 screws for wall mounting. The female threads are shallow and make me a little nervous, but we won't be hanging from the TV. Buy the Samsung UHD TV 6300 and be prepared to be impressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a milestone reward from my job. Beautiful picture. Would prefer a remote with more feature on it, but we were happy to find out we can use the remote from our old Samsung TV for a lot of the settings. One tip, use the \"Movie\" setting to prevent the \"soap opera\" effect. They should tell you that in the instructions! But all in all, very happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The picture on this TV is among the best I have ever seen. Intuitive software practically setup the TV for me. The sound is crisp and clear and the design of the tv is very tasteful. The only issue (though I will not call it a real issue) is that a couple of my standard definition cable channels are not as clear as on my previous \"smaller\" LCD flat panel tv. Maybe just the difference in screen size bring more imperfections into sight....however, with the superior picture and clarity over my previous tv on other SD and HD channels, this is a moot point for me.\n",

      "I've always had the latest and greatest, but this blew my mind. Seeing a 75\" 4K UHD at a friends home I knew it was time to upgrade from an older 720p. Purchased at an unbelievable price it was quick to install and even quicker to impress my wife and I on how the actors seem walk right off the screen into your home. Vivid colors beyond belief. A screen you can control down to the last piece of brightness or darkness. The audio can be set to your needs, and if that isn't enough the 3 HDMI connections will keep you entertained with multiple levels of input which only a king can command. I'm a Samsung home, 3 TV's, 3 Blue Ray Players, 4 Phones and whatever else I can find to buy. We love it!.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just mounted the TV on the wall last night, and love the TV. Fits perfectly above our fireplace. We had our 50\" Plasma for 10 years, and it was time to switch out to a larger one in the family room. The only minor issue I have is I couldn't fully pair it with DirecTv's remote. I can turn the power on/off only. I can't control the volume using the DirecTv remote. Hate having so many controls around. Tried all the different remote code but none works. Hopefully, DirecTv can figure out the correct code or Samsung to supply the correct code.\n",

      "I shopped around for a while and finally decided a 50 Inch TV was perfect for my needs. I already had an entertainment center that I wanted to use and this was the largest size possible. I bought this TV and when I got home I was amazed at how easy it was to set up, it practically set itself up. This is the first \"Smart TV\" I have owned and I was really impressed with the features. It integrated with my surround sound system and my home WIFI network seamlessly. The picture clarity was unreal compared to the 1080P TV I already had. I got it just in time so I could watch the South Carolina vs Clemson game tonight. I cannot imagine a better TV for my own personal needs. This TV exceeded all of my expectations I could not have imagined needing any thing else in a television for myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is our first smart TV. The features are excellent! Setup was smooth and easy. Smart features are cool and easy to use! We will check in later with further information. So far so good!\n",

      "This is an awesome tv best I have ever owned. It was easy to set up and has a great picture and the sound is as good as you can expect from a flat screen\n",

      "The visual and sound is great. Took a minute to initially set up but after i got it setup and settled in, it worked well and is fun.\n",

      "I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS 70 INCH 4K UHD TELEVISION. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE, IT IS THE REAL DEAL IN UHD TV !\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the best UHD tv for the price and size. I have this since 3 days and i love the colours, display sound.. pairs with my phone, laptop. even normal picture look great.. grt buy.. Happy thanksgiving...\n",

      "Easy setup and has beautiful picture. Navigation is easy. Great value.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first step into 4K and I'm very happy about my purchase. The picture is BRIGHT and colors pop and almost give a 3D effect. Samsung has some of the best screens out there and this TV is no exception. Absolutely stunning picture, apps load extremely quick, 4K Netflix playback!.\n",
      "\n",
      "Picture clarity is awesome, 50 inch, a perfect size for my living room. The TV has good sound also, features are easy to use. Would recommend this unit to anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purchased this TV about 2 weeks ago and I am thrilled with my purchase. The features such as having other services like amazon, netflix, and hulu makes this Smart Tv a fantastic value. The picture quality is top notch, clear crisp. One of the greatest features of the TV is the abiltiy to choose picture and sound mode when watching TV shows, movies, sports events. I highly recommend this TV to everyone who wishes to enjoy excellent programming and all the bells and whistles that come with this TV\n",
      "\n",
      "This TV has great features like bluetooth built in as well as wi-fi so you can connect to the Internet easily. Great quality picture with bright colors. Slim design. The speakers sound is good but if you connect your tv to a sound bar ( like I did) it's much better. Not so many apps selection but hopefully Samsung will add more. The only pro that I found is that this TV has no headphone jack and not many AV out options except for the optical.\n",
      "\n",
      "This TV is nothing short of amazing....Paired with a new gaming system and a Samsung surround sound system and who could ask for more !\n",

      "This is our second Samsung UHD 4K TV, we purchased a 55\" about 2y ago and now got a 40\" both of the same model and found them great , the sharpness of the picture, the vivacity of the color, the weight and shape make it truly convenient and easy to carry, it is also easy to set up thanks to the clear directions provided in the manual not forgetting Samsung remote customer support, we can not be happier, so thanks Samung who are staying behind their name, they are really reliable .\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming from 720p to a 4k tv the image quality is awesome\n",
      "\n",
      "So so easy to set up. TV walks you right through it! Beautiful picture! We were watching a football game and you could even see the individual blades of grass! This is our second Samsung television. We are just as pleased with this one as our old one. Love the WiFi access! Would recommend to family and friends. Great buy!\n",
      "\n",
      "I've used Samsung TVs/PC Monitors for several years and I have NEVER been disappointed. I've had a 2010 55\" 1080p Samsung TV that I've used for 6 years and I was very happy with it. When 4K came out, and I saw the clarity in it, I knew I needed to get one, just needed to come up with the cash! Recently buying a PS4 Pro, I decided it was time to use that money and invest into a 4K TV and I am so happy with my purchase. The TV is great, the quality is great, the performance in Game Mode is fantastic! The TV is very easy to navigate through and I think within a week, most people will have figured out the basic features they need and will use every day. The Smart features work very well, and as simple as the remote is, I actually really like it! I recommend this TV to anyone who wants the quality of 4K, without spending too much. This isn't a super high end Samsung TV, but I can say it very well surpassed all of my expectations, so I am 10/10 happy!\n",
      "\n",
      "This Samsung 60 \" TV has a very realistic picture and enhancements that can be done in different viewing modes. Easy to adjust with the simple remote control to access these features and more. A top of the line TV in every aspect. I would definitely recommend this TV to anyone who wants to upgrade to 4K.\n",
      "\n",
      "This tv is so smart I think it may have outsmarted me. I love how crisp and clean the picture looks. The pixel are just right that it can adjust automatically how the brightness can be depending on how dark it is in your home. Im so pleased with my purchase and I will be enjoying this tv for alooonnnnggg time!\n",
      "\n",
      "We bought this Samsung 60\" smart 4k UHD tv as a holiday gift for my husband who wanted a somewhat larger tv for our bedroom. He has seen these new 4k tvs for a few years now, and asked for one. It has an amazing picture and human eyes with 20/20 vision don't see as well as what that tv displays!! It is perfection!! We haven't as yet tried out all the apps and other \"bells and whistles\", but I'm sure we will. It was a very easy set-up ( attaching the base to the tv) and then just plugging it in to cable hdmi and turning it on. We've owned several Samsung products and preferred this brand over others for many, if not most of our electronics.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great TV. Colors are very vivid. The screen is very bright and has great clarity. The TV is very easy to set up and use. It practically does everything for you. The price was reasonable for a great quality TV and since I have two Samsung phones I can sync everything with my TV. I own two Samsung TVs and I wouldn't buy any other brand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bought this TV primarily so I could play PS4. It looks absolutely amazing. The sound quality is great. The apps are simple to use and the interface is very modern. Only downside I've notice so far is the remote. Samsung has chosen a sleek minimalist approach and it doesn't feature any number keys which I'm not a big fan of. Otherwise great TV for a great price.\n",
      "\n",
      "This TV is light for its size and was easy to wall mount and connect to my wireless network , so I could watch my you tube videos\n",
      "\n",
      "I've only had the TV one day, but it has a beautiful picture and is so easy to access settings to get things exactly as I want them. Love that I can just get to Netflix and Amazon without using Roku!! And it was an unbelievable buy for Black Friday so even though I didn't need a new TV, I couldn't pass it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "This TV has a beautiful picture and good sound. The set looks good. Still getting used to remote. Would recommend this KU6300 4KUHD Samsung TV to any one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, This is our 1st Samsung TV.We truely love the features it provided.Also watching movies on Netlfix is all now a new experience. Thank you Samsung :)\n",
      "\n",
      "Purchased this new 4K UHD TV to replace my old 46\" LCD Samsung TV to just get something new at a great price. Works great after consulting with a friend who just purchased the same one getting a couple of hints on the settings. Great picture and the sound is a big difference from my old LCD TV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great resolution, especially in the sports mode. Super color saturation, Great picture quality. Very easy to navigate through the menu. Even the commercials are great to watch, especially the McDonalds adds. The internal speakers are very acceptable. no need for an additional sound bar Overall you will not be sorry with this one. Keep up the good work Samsung.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this TV so much I don't know where to begin. Every feature I could possibly need/want is all here in a neat package. My only issue is that I use a Motorola phone in conjunction with my TV, I just have this feeling that if I were using a galaxy it's be much smoother and I would have all the right apps. Hopefully Samsung continues become more inclusive sooner rather than later.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is such a great product. I am so happy all my research before buying this TV came in handy and I got this brilliant 4K UHD TV with amazing features. I highly recommend this TV!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "This 4K TV was easy to set up, has a great picture and I was watching in 5 minutes. I love the picture and the internet was a snap to get started. Samsung has done everything right with this TV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great deal for the price, remote is different but I like it. So far we really like it!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have had to reset the TV to factory defaults once since purchasing 30 days ago in order to get the TV to connect to my WIFI. Additionally, have had to log out and back into TV WIFI network several times to try and get it to connect. TV is 15 feet away from my router with no obstructions in the way. Tonight I had to set the DNS to 8.8.8.8 and unplug the TV for 60 seconds and back in to get it reconnected (via Chat help). I have confirmed it is not my router since the WII right below the TV is able to immediately access my network and internet to watch Netflix. Concerned that I am going to continue to have issues with this functionality, which is why I purchased a SmartTV rather than use a different device (e.g. my WII).\n",
      "\n",
      "I have had a few flat screen TV's and I must say that this TV is a great buy and a great picture. The sound is also good. I have had other brands of Flat Screen TV's and the sound was not as good as the Samsung I purchased.\n",
      "\n",
      "This TV has a great picture and several features. Got a great deal on it during the holidays. Replaced my old Plasma which was about 9-10 years old and the picture quality is such an upgrade. The smart hub is easiy to use and offers great features for streaming shows/movies and other content from any device.\n",
      "\n",
      "HD and Blue Ray are amazing on this TV. Tons of built in apps make this a great purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. I am very please with my new Flat Screen TV! 2. The unit did not come on when removed from the box. However, a call to Customer Service resolved the challenges. 3. The remote control unit is unique and different, however, once I learned the functions, it was fine. 4. This was an excellent investment and purchase!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Cant go wrong here, Samsung really is the Ferrari of T.V.s. Easy set up, Easy to use, Easy remote, Easy menu to navigate. Plug and play!\n",
      "\n",
      "While we bought a smart TV...it was more for the picture than the other features. It was fairly easy to set up (with some help from a younger friend). Some day we may venture into the other features. The picture makes you feel like you are there.\n",
      "\n",
      "This set was easy setup. In no time at all we were watching a beautiful picture that made us feel as if we were in it. It's definitely a keeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm replacing my son's HD TV with this model. He now has a new 4K UHD TV. He notices a differences in the old TV and the new. He states that it's clear, vibrate, and bright. I have a X Box One S, PS4 Pro and cable attached to his TV. The only thing I wish they did was include another HDMI port. It would have been have to have 4 ports instead of three. Love the brand! This is my second Samsung TV. Had no problems so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "The picture screen is outstanding. The unit was easy to assemble and is light weight. Also, very well packaged and protected from damage. The sound system is also very good. The size of the screen and of the flat screen itself is great, as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up to this point I have yet to purchase a product I was so thoroughly disappointed with. Let's set aside the fact that I have a line of dead pixels running down the middle of my screen. Let's instead focus on how stupid it is to manufacture a product that lets apps update to a point where they become incompatible with the TV itself (insert expletive). I managed to purchase a TV that fails at every aspect of what it was designed to do. Sure, it presents images on a screen but so does my grandmother's TV from the 50s and shockingly without a black line running down the middle. If you are reading this I hope you look elsewhere to another brand! Smarthub is complete garbage, how hard is it to make a patch Samsung!!? According to customer service, the only answer is to return the product while I still can.\n",
